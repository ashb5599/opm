# Slope Stability Monitoring System (Open Pit Mine)

This project was developed for the Smart India Hackathon (SIH). It uses real-time geotechnical sensor data and AI models to predict slope failures in open pit mines. The backend is built with Django REST framework and the frontend uses React.

## Setup Instructions

### Backend

1. Navigate to the backend folder:

```bash
cd opm/backend
```

2. Install Python dependencies:

```bash
pip install django djangorestframework django-cors-headers requests numpy pandas xgboost scikit-learn
```

3. Run the Django development server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

The backend API will be available at `http://localhost:8000/api/`

### Frontend

1. Navigate to the frontend folder:

```bash
cd opm/frontend
```

2. (Only required the first time) Install npm packages:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the React development server:

```bash
npm start
```

The frontend UI will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## Notes

- Make sure the backend is running before starting the frontend to avoid API errors.
- The frontend communicates with the backend at port 8000 by default.
- The backend is a scaffold and not fully configured with the core programming logic. Currently working on integrating AI models and data processing code into the Django views.
